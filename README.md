This mini-project is a command-line finance tracker that allows users to log transactions, view summaries, and analyse spending habits over a given date range. The program reads and writes data to a CSV file, ensuring transactions are persistently stored. Users can add transactions (income/expenses), filter by date and generate visual representations of their financial data using Matplotlib. I used this project as a way to apply what I've learned about the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries in a practical way.

Key Features
✅ Transaction Logging – Users can input income and expenses with descriptions.
✅ Date Range Filtering – Transactions can be retrieved and summarised within a specified period.
✅ Financial Summary – Calculates total income, expenses, and net savings.
✅ Data Persistence – Transactions are stored in a CSV file for future access.
✅ Data Visualisation – Generates a line graph displaying income and expenses over time.

Skills Developed
📊 Data Manipulation with Pandas – Used Pandas to read, filter, and process CSV-based financial data.
📉 Data Visualisation with Matplotlib – Plotted income and expenses over time for insights.
📝 File Handling – Implemented CSV-based data storage and retrieval.
⏳ Date & Time Processing – Converted and filtered date-based transactions using pd.to_datetime().
🛡 Input Validation & Error Handling – Ensured user-friendly interaction by handling invalid inputs.
🔄 Modular Design – Created reusable functions for cleaner, scalable code.

This project improved my ability to develop interactive applications, work with structured data and apply fundamental software engineering principles, making it a great introduction to data-driven Python development!
